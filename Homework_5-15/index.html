<h1>What is the DOM?</h1> 
<ol>
  
  <li>How would you add a css class with Vanilla Javascript?</li>
    <h2>document.getElementById("Element").classList.add('newClass');</h2>
  <li>How would you remove a css class with Vanilla Javascript?</li>
    <h2>"Element".classList.remove("red")</h2>
  <li>Explain the Differences Between the Window and Document for JavaScript Development</li>
    <h2>The window is where the Document is inserted and the Document contains everything else.</h2>
  <li>What are query selectors?</li>
    <h2>refers to the CSS selectors in the document</h2>
  <li>HowWhat are Javascript event listners?</li>
    <h2>triggers within a document that "listen" for a specific action</h2>
  <li>What is onclick and what can we use it for?</li>
    <h2>It is a type of trigger to execute a bit of code specified when a mouse is "clicked" on specific item</h2>
  <li>What is the difference between onclick and addEventListener?</li>
    <h2>
      addEventListener effectively assigns a callback to some internal array of listener callbacks
       that will all be called whenever the event is triggered.

      onclick is a single property with a single value. When you assign to it, the old value is replaced 
        by the new assignment.

      </ul>
    </h2>

  <li>What is the javascript Toggle function?</li>
    <h2>toggles between hide and show methods</h2>
  <li>What are UML Structural Diagrams?</li>
    <h2>Capture static aspects or structure of a system</h2>
  <li>What are UML Behavioral Diagrams?</li>
    <h2>
      They depict the elements of a system that are dependent on time and that
       convey the dynamic concepts of the system and how they relate to each other
      </h2>
  <li>What are UML Class Diagram Associations, Multiplicity, and Navigability?</li>
      <h2>
        Each one of those is needed in order to properly set up an association 
          inside of a class diagram
      </h2>
  <li>What are UML Activity Diagrams?</li>
      <h2>Activity diagram is basically a flowchart to represent the flow from one 
        activity to another activity
      </h2>
  <li>What are UML Use Case Diagrams?</li>
      <h2>
        are usually referred to as behavior diagrams used to describe a set of 
          actions (use cases) that some system or systems (subject) should or can 
            perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system (actors).
      </h2>
  <li>What are UML Deployment Diagrams?</li>
      <h2>
        a diagram that shows the configuration of run time processing nodes and the

      </h2>
  <li>What are UML Package Diagrams?</li>
      <h2>
        structure diagram which shows packages and dependencies between the packages. 
      </h2>
  <li>What are UML Interaction Sequence Diagrams?</li>
      <h2>
        represents the ordered sequence of interactions within a system
      </h2>
  <li>What are UML State Machine Diagrams?</li>
      <h2>
        a behavior diagram which shows discrete behavior of a 
          part of designed system through finite state transitions.
      </h2>
