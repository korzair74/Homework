<h1> Introduction to Programming with Python</h1>

  <ol>
    <li> What is List Comprehension in Python?</li>
      <h2>provide a concise way to create lists</h2>
    <li> What is a Python Conditional and what is it used for?</li>
      <h2>expressions that return value A or value B depending on whether a Boolean value is true or false</h2>
    <li> What happens when you return a value for a python method/function</li>
      <h2>The statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned.</h2>
    <li> What is a default argument and explain a use case.</li>
      <h2>default argument is used if to always have even if not specified</h2>
    <li> What is a named argument?</li>
      <h2>When you call a function, you can precede some or all of the arguments by a name and an equal sign</h2>
    <li> What does the *args do in a python function and how might you use it?</li>
      <h2>used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function, used if you do not know the number of values to be passed</h2>
    <li> What are Keyword Arguments in Python?</li>
      <h2>where you provide a name to the variable as you pass it into the function</h2>

<h1>Advanced Python Programming</h1>

  <ol>
    <li> What is a Class in python?</li>
      <h2>A class is a code template for creating objects</h2>
    <li> What is a dunder method in Python</li>
      <h2>methods having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name.</h2>
    <li> What is self in python and how might we use it?</li>
      <h2>self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” keyword we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python</h2>
    <li> How does inheritance work in python?</li>
      <h2>Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.</h2>
    <li> What is pipenv?</li>
      <h2>Pipenv is a dependency manager for Python projects</h2>
    <li> What is Polymorphism</li>
      <h2>Polymorphism and Method Overriding</h2>
    <li> What is the purpose of init in python</li>
      <h2>method called when an object is created from the class and it allow the class to initialize the attributes of a class</h2>
    <li> What is a decorator and what is its purpose in python</li>
      <h2>any callable Python object that is used to modify a function or a class,  decorators wrap a function, modifying its behavior. Before moving on</h2>
    <li> What is a Generator in python</li>
      <h2>functions which return an iterable set of items, yielding each one in its turn.</h2>
    <li> How do you declare a new instance of a class?</li>
      <h2>To instantiate a class, we simply call the class as if it were a function, passing the arguments that the __init__ method defines</h2>
  </ol>

<h1> Python API Development with Flask </h1>

  <ol>
    <li> What is Flask?</li>
      <h2>Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.</h2>
    <li> What is an API?</li>
      <h2>An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.</h2>
    <li> What is the purpose of an API endpoint</li>
      <h2>the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other </h2>
    <li> What is pipenv?</li>
      <h2>Pipenv is a dependency manager for Python projects</h2>
    <li> What is SQLite?</li>
      <h2> self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. </h2>
    <li> Explain how you can use the HTTP verb POST</li>
      <h2>Used to create an HTTP resource, its the C in the CRUD operation</h2>
    <li> Explain how you can use the HTTP verb GET</li>
      <h2>Used to read an HTTP resouce, its the R in the CRUD operation</h2>
    <li> Explain how you can use the HTTP verb PUT</li>
      <h2>Used to update an existing HTTP resource, its the U in the CRUD operation</h2>
    <li> Explain how you can use the HTTP verb DELETE</li>
      <h2>Used to remove an HTTP resouce, its the D in the CRUD operation</h2>
    <li> Explain what SQLAlchemy is?</li>
      <h2>database toolkit and object-relational mapper, its a generalized interface for creating and executing database-agnostic code without needing to write SQL statements. </h2>
